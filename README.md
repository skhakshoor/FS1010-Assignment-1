This simple landing page of the "Toronto City" has the following features:

* Simple full screen navigation
* Responsive layout using media query, flex box and grid system
* Overlay effect on hover of images
* "Open Sans" Google Fonts - regular and bold
* font awesome icons in the footer

** Note: Instead of using linear gradient, I used "clip-path" which I found it easier to adjust with screen size.
